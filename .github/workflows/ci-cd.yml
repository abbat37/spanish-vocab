jobs:

  # JOB 1: TEST
  # This job runs your tests to ensure code quality
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use Ubuntu Linux virtual machine

    # POSTGRESQL SERVICE
    # Spin up PostgreSQL in a Docker container for testing
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        # Set up PostgreSQL with test credentials

    steps:
      # STEP 1: Get the code
      # This clones your repository to the GitHub Actions runner
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # 'uses' means we're using a pre-built action from GitHub marketplace
        # actions/checkout is maintained by GitHub and clones your repo

      # STEP 2: Set up Python
      # Install Python on the virtual machine
